# ToDoList
When a user clicks on the + button, a text input at the end of the list can be editable, and hide the + button.
Once text input is visible, If the user types and presses enter key, a new item is added to the end of the list.
Once text input is visible, If the user types nothing and presses enter key,it gives an error to enter something.
Once text input is visible, If the user presses the Esc key, it hides the text input and shows back the + button again.
The list is scrollable but the date and time should be sticky at the top of the list.
The list items created on a day is available all the time, for the same day, and do not get remove on reloading. But if the user opens the list the next day, it gets reset with no items. For this, data is set in local storage with condition comparing year,month and date respectively.
